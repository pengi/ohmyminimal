oh-my-minimal
=============

A reduced down version of oh-my-zsh, with only a bare minimum of useful plugins

Made for use on pengis own minimalistic systems

What has been removed is for example:
- auto update
- error handling

So you will get strange errors for bad configuration, and no automatic updates
